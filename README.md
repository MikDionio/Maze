# Maze

## Rationale
This project was made for the DevelUP App Process ARG. It is meant to serve as one of the challenges to obtain clues in order to solve the ARG. The maze itself was inspired by a similar maze I created during Global Game Jam 2019 (which sadly could not be uploaded since it was not completed). This became my opportunity to complete and improve upon it.

## Tech
This game is made using Unity3D with Probuilder and Progrids.

## Credits
The portal scripts and shaders used in this project are from this tutorial by Brackeys - [Smooth Portals in unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuQao3hEKfs)
